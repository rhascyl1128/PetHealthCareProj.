        <p>
          A group of college students is complied by their professor to make a static website for their
          final
          project.
          The group present a different area, topics to make and one of that is the Pet Health Care.
          Their professor picked the suggested area and right away the group discussed about the constructing of the
          website, everyone gives their thoughts and opinion on how the website will going to look like.
          Because
          the area that assigned to us is a Pet Health Care the group come up about a website that offer a service for
          pets and
          giving an advice on what to do when their pets experiencing common sickness, immediately the group make a
          web lay out of it.
          After getting the approval for the lay out the group start to build the said website, and that’s how the
          <span>Pawsitive</span> start.
