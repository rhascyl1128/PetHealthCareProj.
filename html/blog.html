          <strong>Q. Why Pawsitive?

          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> You must select someone in whom both you and your pet have faith. You must have them
            available on the correct days, at
            the proper times, and sometimes even at the last minute. Of course, you want them to be experienced and good
            with
            animals. These are the issues that Pawsitive addresses. Our objective is to make scheduling and receiving
            pet care as
            simple as possible for you.

          <strong>Q. My pet ate something that could be poisonous. Who do I contact?

          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> Call your veterinarian immediately. If you have packaging for the substance, have it handy,
            so you can
            better answer
            your veterinarian's questions.

          <strong>Q. What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule?
          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> At Pawsitive, we understand that "life happens" and plans change. There is no penalty for
            cancelling or
            rescheduling
            but we appreciate being notified as soon as possible.</p>

        <div class="faqs">
          <strong>Q. My pet seems to be in pain while walking or running. What should I do?
          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> This could be a sign of an injury, or a chronic condition like arthritis. If your pet is
            showing signs
            of joint pain,
            or has difficulty moving or standing up, let your veterinarian know right away.

        <div class="faqs">
          <strong>Q. My pet has a persistent, dry cough. What should I do?
          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> An ongoing dry cough may be a sign that your dog has "kennel cough"— highly contagious
            upper respiratory
            viral and
            bacterial infections that affect your dog's voice box and windpipe. If you suspect you dog has kennel cough,
            isolate
            them from other dogs right away, and call your veterinarian.

        <div class="faqs">
          <strong>Q. What are the signs that my pet may have allergies?
          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> Your pet can show allergic symptoms when its immune system begins fighting off everyday
            substances, or
            allergens,
            such as pollen, mold spores, dust, or cigarette smoke. If your pet has allergies, coming into contact with a
            certain
            substance, including eating or inhaling it, may result in a reaction. Look out for signs of allergies,
            including
            increased scratching, moist or reddish skin, runny eyes, sneezing, vomiting or itchy base of the tail
            (usually an
            allergy to fleas, called flea allergy dermatitis). If you notice any of these signs, contact your
            veterinarian.</p>

          <strong>Q. I think my pet has a skin problem. How can I tell?
          </strong>
          <p><span>A.</span> Your pet's skin is an indicator of overall health. If your pet is experiencing these
            following symptoms, or any other
            symptoms, you should contact your veterinarian:
            Irritated red or inflamed skin,
            Scabs or scaly patches,
            Skin discoloration
